10/2/25, 9:48 AM - Aswath IT: Its okay ill bring u back...You want to analyze a WhatsApp group chat export (chat.txt) to find out which participants have been inactive. Specifically, you want to identify those who did not send or interact in the group chat recently (e.g., did not open or send any message since yesterday or a defined recent period). The goal is to obtain a reliable list of active versus inactive users, where "inactive" means genuinely no activity or message contribution in that timeframe.

10/2/25, 10:09 AM - Aswath IT: To keep it simple, just get the count of messages sent by each member who has spoken in the group.
10/2/25, 10:09 AM - Aswath IT: this is enough
10/2/25, 10:09 AM - +91 81486 93484: 👍
10/2/25, 10:11 AM - Aswath IT: Simplified problem statement:

The task is to analyze a WhatsApp group chat export to quantify participation by each member who has sent messages in the group. The goal is to produce a simple report showing the total number of messages sent by only those members who have spoken up. There is no need to identify inactive or silent members; the analysis focuses solely on those who contributed messages.

10/2/25, 10:22 AM - Aswath IT: To find the active and inactive members u need the list of members present in the group....for 40 members u can list it but for 1000 members u can't list out there requires a lot of api routing that will be hard to do as of now for u guys...so move with the simplified problem statemnt
